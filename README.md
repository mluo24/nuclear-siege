# Nuclear Siege

This game was made as part of the final project for my AP Computer Science A class.

----

The nuclear plant you work at had a huge accident, turning most things around you into mutants! These mutants are out to attack you and destroy the nuclear reactor, which will instantly kill you if destroyed. Fight off the siege of enemies and save yourself! If you or the core health run out, you lose.

## How to Play

Use the `left` and `right` keys to move, `up` to jump, and `space` to shoot.
